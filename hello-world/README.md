# Hello World

There's not mush to say, besides the "naming conventions of files are Pascal Case".

To run this example:

```bash
cd hello-world
swift HelloWorld.swift
```

## Notice

Maybe it's not a good idea to run Swift projects like this.

It seems people use Xcode to work with pure Swift projects, even though there is no SwiftUI involved.
